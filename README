Introductory Haskell
==================


This is some supporting code for a talk I gave called "Haskell through Clojure-tinted Glasses" at the TriClojure meetup group.

You can load (for example) Main.hs into ghci to play around with it.

        ghci Main.hs

If you want to try out Copy.hs, you can either compile it with

        ghc --make Main.hs

or open it with ghci and set your arguments

        ghci Copy.hs
        Main> :set args file1 file2
        Main> main

To try out QuickCheck.hs

        ghci QuickCheck.hs
        Main> quickCheck prop_minimum
        Main> quickCheck prop_ordered
